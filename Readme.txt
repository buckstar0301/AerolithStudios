Hey guys.

Can we create an organisation under the name "AerolithStudios", and create a repository with that account called "Catch Me if You Can", and then a branch in that repository called "Master"?

Also, Can we choose to only sync certain things? (just the script we were working on etc)? --> on review, yes.

Because then we could create a branch for each stream that we're working on (random generation/movement/sound/etc)..

Then we sync to the master only when a mechanic/script/etc is fully functional and ready to be solidly implemented?


Don't forget, I'm new to GitHub and don't know how it works yet - so feel free to veto/correct me/suggest a better option.

Dunks

P.S.
On review and after looking at the tutorial, it looks like we can do exactly this. Moreover, can we please send 'merge Requests' in order to consolidate in Master? That way everyone gets a chance to review the code.

Project so far is on it's way btw!
