Hey guys.

Can we create an account or something under the name "AerolithStudios", and create a repository with that account called "Catch Me if You Can", and then a branch in that repository called "Master"?

Also, Can we choose to only sync certain things? (just the script we were working on etc)?

Because then we could create a branch for each stream that we're working on (random generation/movement/sound/etc)..

Then we sync to the master only when a mechanic/script/etc is fully functional and ready to be solidly implemented?


Don't forget, I'm new to GitHub and don't know how it works yet - so feel free to veto/correct me/suggest a better option.

Dunks
